# evm-wallet-generator

This is my first bot. So, I hope you'll enjoy it.

TL;DR => 
This is The Ethereum AUTO Wallet Generator. So, you didn't need to take a lot of time to create tons of wallets. <br>
Just install the script, enter the number of wallets that you want, and it's done!

How to use?

First, you need to clone this repo: <br>
```
git clone https://github.com/dante4rt/evm-wallet-generator.git
```

<br>

Then, you need to install it: <br>
```
npm install
```
or 
```
npm i
```

<br>

Finally, you can run it: <br>
```
node index.js
```

Put the amount that you want, example: 5 wallets => Input "5".

<br>

Remember: <br>
You need to have NodeJS on your computer => https://nodejs.org/en.
